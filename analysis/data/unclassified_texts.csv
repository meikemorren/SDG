A series of articles based on fortnightly administrative data from the Australian Longitudinal Data Set (LDS) illustrate again the high frequency of repeated spells and emphasize the importance of considering transfers across different income-support programmes. For the 1995 inflow sample of recipients of means-tested single parent benefits, Gregory & Klug (2003) show that spell lengths tend to be short with 45% of all spells lasting shorter than one year."

Women experience more disadvantages when they live in poor households. For example, in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen, girls and boys from the wealthiest quintile have relatively similar net school attendance rates in primary education, but in the poorest quintile the net school attendance of girls is lower than that of boys by 17 and 25 percentage points respectively.19 In households with poor access to clean water and energy, women bear most of the resulting work burden and harmful health effects (see Chapter 7 — Environment)."

For example, the experience since the elimination of the international quota regime on textiles and clothing suggests that poverty reduction through labour-intensive exports is not sustainable without the development of backward linkages."

This is an extreme expression of discrimination against women and of their lack of autonomy, not only physical autonomy, but also economic and decision-making autonomy. Violence against women cannot be analysed and tackled in isolation, but must be considered bound up with the economic, social and cultural inequality that operate in the power relations between men and women, which are in turn mirrored in inequality of resources in the private and public domains and are directly related to the unequal distribution of labour, especially unpaid domestic work."

In Estonia, the new Labour Code enforced in July 2009, radically changed the menu of remedies available to courts in the case of unfair dismissals, by making the possibility of reinstatement conditional on the agreement of both parties - except in certain discrimination cases - and halving the amount of compensation that should be paid to the worker. In addition, notification requirements for individual dismissals were simplified and notice periods and severance pay schedules made more progressive with respect to job tenure and, on average, somewhat smaller.

For example, the ITC survey of Malawian exporters registered 58 NTM cases applied by the government of Malawi compared with 48 by importing partners (ITC 2012).

In order to account for this development, we introduce an agent-based model that combines a natural-selection logic with an adaptive mechanism of regime change. The latter is implemented as an empirically calibrated, contextual rule that prompts democratization as an S-shaped function of the democratic share of a state's immediate neighborhood.

I argue that Islamist movements cannot be fruitfully analysed as primarily oppositional mobilisations.

It examines the most important contextual factors for languages in Northern Ireland, and deals with two main areas: languages in the education system and languages in the community. In both sections, it discusses both policy and practice together. A final section draws together the main issues and the implications of Brexit for languages in Northern Ireland. It argues that what is now urgently needed is a radically different level of awareness, not only in wider society in Northern Ireland, but also in education and in local government, of the importance of languages for peace, community relations, security, trade, diplomacy, international relations and crucially, for intercultural understanding (at home and abroad)."

However, a critical reflection on their added value and on how contemporary ‘design-thinking’  approaches relates to the classical idea of public administration as a design science, is still lacking.  This introductory paper reflects upon the use of design approaches in public administration. We  delve into the more traditional ideas of design as launched by Simon and policy design, but also  into the present-day design wave, stemming from traditional design sciences. Based upon this we  distinguish between three ideal-type approaches of design currently characterising the discipline:  design as optimisation, design as exploration and design as co-creation. More rigorous empirical  analyses of applications of these approaches is necessary to further develop public administration  as a design science. We reflect upon the question of how a more designerly way of thinking can  help to improve public administration and public policy."

In this short piece, I argue that there is an interesting tension between thinking about intergenerational equity and new media through a standard future-oriented lens and thinking about it through the lens of the common law. The tension can be briefly described as between variations of a classic Schmupeterian ""creative destruction"" on the one hand and the role of courts, law, and precedent in a common-law system on the other, what we might call ""creative construction."" I use this framework to focus on the ways in which courts rely on First Amendment institutions to further innovations-both legal and technological-whose effects in turn may transcend the present generation."

A comprehensive search of the current literature on this topic reveals a paucity of attention and understanding in this area, despite an increasing focus on children's services in art museums. In order to bridge this gap, the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) is highlighted as an international vehicle for entrenching the participatory rights of children in cultural life and the Arts from birth. Lundy's model for participation based on ‘space, voice, audience and influence’ is interpreted for an art museum setting. Promoting children's cultural rights shapes museums into more democratic institutions, thereby activating the public art museum's founding principles."
